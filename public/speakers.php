                     Let's face it, the biggest attraction of any conference are the talks and the speakers.
                     At True North PHP, we intend to assemble a diverse selection of compelling talks.  We hope
                     to showcase the great selection of talent Toronto has to offer, and to mix in recognizable
                     speakers from around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We expect to have 30 - 35 speaking slots.
