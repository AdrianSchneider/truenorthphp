I\'ll be discussing some strategies for profiling, and improving performance. I\'ll be taking a full stack approach in this talk starting with the browser and Javascript runtime issues. Following that, we\'ll look at some simple but rewarding HTTP optimizations around caching and reducing requests. Lastly, we\'ll look at profiling PHP, what to look for and how to fix things. Some tools I\'ll be discussing are: Chrome dev tools, siege, XHprof and Xdebug. The talk will be given in the framework of some simple rules/guidelines that will hopefully help people make decisions in the future.',
