Whether it\'s hashing passwords or encrypting sensitive user data, the security requirements are daunting. Yet you don\'t need to be an expert in cryptography to implement it correctly. All you need to do is understand the basics, and trust the experts. 
In this talk, we\'ll take a look at some of the basic concepts of cryptography and how to implement them in PHP. Additionally, we\'ll discuss the common problems that developers face and how best to solve them. Finally, we\'ll dispel some of the myth and rumors around password hashing and how (and more importantly why) to do it properly.',

      'text' => 'When it comes to Object Oriented Programming, there is no shortage of guidelines and principles for how to properly design an OO system. There is also no shortage of acronyms to describe these principles: DRY, SRP, LSP, LoD, ISP, OCP, etc. However, there are two acronyms that really shine through to describe how to, and how not to do OOP well. The two acronyms are SOLID and STUPID (respectively). We\'ll discuss some of the underlying principles of Object Oriented Programming, and how we can learn from the principles identified by each of these two acronyms. Additionally, we\'ll explore some additional anti-patterns of Object Oriented Design and how they can be avoided. Finally, we\'ll talk about how all of this applies to our every day development tasks, and the real-world benefit these design principles provide...
This is a re-hash of a talk that I did for NYPHP, cut down for time (the original talk is 1:20 plus comments, so I would re-vamp and update the content for the shorter format.  See the prior talk here: http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/05/dont-be-stupid-grasp-solid-slides.html',
