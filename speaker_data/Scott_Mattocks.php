Without adding the code itself as a trusted member of the group, these teams are missing a significant part of the picture. Writing code that contributes to the conversation through documentation, logging, monitoring and testing is the only way to produce a high quality, maintainable system. In this talk we will look at responsible development practices that not only make the code do what it is told, but allow the code to communicate effectively with you, the developer.',
