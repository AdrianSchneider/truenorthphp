      'text' => 'In the spirit of open source, I\'d like to shine a spotlight on mental illness. Not because it\'s easy, but because it\'s important. Mental illness affects many of us, but the stigma attached to it dissuades most people from talking about it openly. That\'s not how we make progress. With this talk, I want to do my part.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was thirteen, and I\'ve been struggling with it my whole life. In this talk, I\'ll discuss how it has impacted my work as a developer, husband, and father.
By speaking openly about my own challenges and successes, I hope those struggling with mental illness will learn how to be happier and more productive, and others can better understand how to be helpful and supportive.',
