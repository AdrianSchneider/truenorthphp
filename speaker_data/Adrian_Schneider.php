This talk is the result of the last 100 applications I\'ve built, and how a ton of experimentation, many failures, and some success has made me really appreciate good software design. Having worked from all angles (stakeholder, team lead, PM, consultant, solo), I\'ve come to realize how much of an affect design has on the outcome of a project. We\'ll explore the following topics:
# Overview of Topics
## Software Architecture
- Thought leaders
- My progressions / milestones over past 10 years / porting ideas to PHP
- Framework as an implementation detail
- As a lead/architect, how can I maximize my impact
- As a stakeholder: how can I minimize my costs
- As a developer: how can I build simpler applications
## Domain Modeling
- How to properly model what you\'re building
- Domain driven design / Aggregates / Bounded Contexts
- Business language vs. framework lingo (what is a Bundle?)
## Types of Work
- Agency work: fast-paced, abstract out "modules", framework-oriented for efficiency
- Maintenance: appreciate how much waste we create
- Product development: Lasts a long time, potentially volatile at first
- R&amp;D / Conceptual: good for experimentation before building critical systems
- Balance in all areas is crucial
## Quality &amp; Testing
- Testing, is it worth it? (types, granularity, investment/reward)
- How it affects your architectural decisions (TDD)
## Tools
- Progression in technology
- How dev/QA tools affect architecture
- Build your own tools',
