      'text' => 'Talk, heavy on code-samples, covering 2 major areas:
1) how Laravel works out of the box (feels full-stack like Cake/Rails)
- how to get a basic site up and running
   - built-in support for multiple environment configurations
   - creating routes
   - resource controllers &amp; restful controllers
   - eloquent ORM
   - making use of db migrations &amp; seeding
   - how Laravel tries to encourage testing
2) how to make Laravel your bitch (it\'s component based, using composer)
- subbing in your own components for Laravel\'s (example: authenticating against an api instead of direct to the database)
Happy to provide more detail, or alter the talk based on feedback.
This would be my first talk at a large conference, but I gave a well received 15 minute "intro to laravel" at a recent "Explode Code" in London, to an audience of approximately 70 people.',
